The Mouse Jiggler is an ideal solution for those who need to take short breaks during their day, as it can keep the computer active while they take a quick break. Additionally, it can be used to keep the computer active for long periods of time, and you don't need to worry about your computer going into sleep mode.

This Jiggler device is small and easy to use, and it can be connected to any USB port. But the thing is those devices are a little costly, and you can also see some DIY ideas to make a Jiggler.But who knows how long that will work. Keeping an active status is always a big team nowadays. So I decide to make my own Mouse Jiggler.

For this project, I'm planning to use Seeed's Xiao RP2040 with the USB Mouse HID program.

The Seeed Studio XIAO RP2040 is as small as the Seeed Studio XIAO SAMD21 but it's more powerful. On one hand, it carries the powerful Dual-core RP2040 processor that can flexible clock running up to 133 MHz which is a low-power microcontrollers. On the Seeed Studio XIAO RP2040 there is also 264KB of SRAM, and 2MB of on-board Flash memory which can provide more program to save and run. On the other hand, this little board has good performance in processing but needs less power.
All in all, it is designed in a tiny size as small as a thumb(20x17.5mm) and can be used for wearable devices and small projects.

There are 14 GPIO PINs on Seeed Studio XIAO RP2040, on which there are 11 digital pins, 4 analog pins, 11 PWM Pins,1 I2C interface, 1 UART interface, 1 SPI interface, 1 SWD Bonding pad interface.

Seeed Studio XIAO RP2040 is compatible to the Seeed Studio XIAO expansion board.
